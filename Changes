Revision history for Perl extension Bigtop.

0.17 Mon Oct  2 09:50:12 CDT 2006
    - There is a new Backend: Conf Gantry.  It makes files ready for
      immediate deployment to /etc/gantry.d when /etc/gantry.conf has an
      include /etc/gantry.d/*.conf.
    - Corrected tentmaker error which did not allow proper creation of new
      config variables.
    - Added html_form_default_value as a legal field statement.  Gantry form
      templates already understood it.  It's now in tentmaker's quick edit.
    - Several statements now pretty print (a little bit) on deparse.
    - Improved maintainability of AJAX expected response test files.
    - Corrected Postgres SQL backend's datetime type.

0.16 Mon Sep 25 09:57 CDT 2006
    - Added a field set label to default form methods.
    - Corrected tentmaker error which caused tentmaker to dump its Quick
      Edit box when new fields were made.
    - Converted many tentmaker tests to check the AJAX response rather
      than just the deparsed tree, this would have caught the previous error.

0.15 Thu Sep 21 12:29:17 CDT 2006
    Highlights:
        many-to-many support for DBIx::Class
        ASCII art for specifying table relationships try:
            bigtop -n AppName 'pos->job job<->skill'
        augment an existing bigtop file with bigtop and tentmaker flags
        Gantry controllers now have (a few) generated page hit tests
        tentmaker...
            has a new Field Quick Edit box for its most common edits
            allows multiple fields to be made at once
            has much more magic to save even more time
        stand alone servers have flags to change database connection info

    - Added support for three way joins (many to many) relationships
      for dbix class models.
    * Added ASCII art input to bigtop script, try this:
        bigtop -n AppName 'pos->job job<->skill'
      You get four tables: pos, job, skill, and job_skill with a reference
      column in pos storing a job id and a many-to-many between job and skill.
    * Added --add flag (aka -a) to bigtop script:
        bigtop -a docs/yourapp.bigtop 'app->pos resume<->app'
      adds app and resume tables and controllers plus a resume_app joining
      table.
    * Applied --new and --add flags to tentmaker in exactly the way
      they apply to bigtop (they even share the implementation code which is
      factored out into Bigtop::ScriptHelp).
    - Comments are preserved on deparse, meaning they will survive a
      trip through tentmaker.  This also facilitates the --add flag.
      One caveat: if you have blank lines or split long statements across
      lines, comments below that point will be shifted down in the output,
      but at least they won't be summarily deleted.
    - Corrected the error message when app level block names are omitted.
    * Expanded generated stand alone servers so you can change database
      DBDs, names, user names, and/or passwords with command line flags.
      Editing the generated app.server makes it easy to change the defaults
      (then you should turn probably off generation of it).
    - Sequences are no longer generated by default.
    - Navigation links are now generated in the site_links method of the
      base module.
    - Defaults now always call the database app.db.
    - Base modules now come in stub and GEN pieces so their nav links
      can be regenerated.
    - DBIx::Class schema modules are now split into stub and GEN pieces
      so the GEN piece can be regened when new tables are added to the
      data model.
    * When you change the name of table in tentmaker, the controller now
      updates its controls_table statement (but not its own name).  Foreign
      keys pointing to the table have their refers_to statements updated
      (but not their own names).
    * When you change the name of a field in tentmaker, it now walks the
      parse tree updating that name wherever it occurs (including: the
      label of the field, the cols of the controller's main_listing,
      the controller's form method, and the foreign_display).
    * The Gantry Control backend now makes more tests.  There are pod
      and pod coverage tests (which require have Test::Pod and
      Test::Pod::Coverage).  There is also a file of run tests which use
      Gantry::Server to test front page hits of each generated controller.
    * tentmaker now has a quick edit box with a row for each field allowing
      one small place to modify a lot of important data.  Any field keyword
      will show in the box, if it's Bigtop::Keywords entry has a quick_label.
    * tentmaker now allows multiple fields to be constructed at once, simply
      separate them with spaces in the Name(s) box.
    * When a field's SQL type becomes date or it has date_select_text
      set on it in tentmaker, everything is done to make the Gantry
      easy date scheme work.
    - Gantry stub controllers finally inherit from their gen modules.  This
      allows overriding gen methods without hastle and easier use of plugins
      provided by the framework (which are themselves mixins).
    - Killing the tentmaker now prompts to ask if you want to save changes.
    - Corrected long standing (but unnoticed) bug which would build in
      the wrong directory when base_dir is used without app_dir.
    - Added controller level config block support to deparser so they
      can pass undisturbed (save whitespace normalization) through tentmaker.
    - Simplified the abstract syntax tree and standardized the naming of
      various elements in it.

0.14 Wed Aug 16 16:20 CDT 2006
    Highlights:
    1. Quicker app generation in two ways.
        Way 1 (if you have sqlite installed):
            bigtop --new App table1 table2
            cd App
            # create database 
            # populate database from docs/schema.yourdb
            ./app.server

        Way 2:
            tentmaker
            on app body tab create table1 and table2
            save as file.bigtop
            bigtop --create file.bigtop
            cd Sample
            sqlite app.db < docs/schema.sqlite
            ./app.server
    2. DBIx::Class support
    3. All around better defaults

    - Changed the full use default, moving it from true for Gantry controllers
      to being true for Gantry HttpdConf.
    - Converted to DBIx::Class (was Class::DBI::Sweet) for tentmaker default.
    - Corrected error that left Gantry AutoCRUD forms for DBIx::Class
      failing to pass the schema object to get_form_selections.
    - Added instance keyword to HttpdConf Gantry backend, which works
      like the same keyword in the CGI Gantry backend.  Both of them allow
      you to get the proper GantryConfInstance definition for use with
      Gantry::Conf.
    - Added conffile keyword to HttpdConf Gantry and CGI Gantry backends.
      Use it with instance to specify a replacement for /etc/gantry.conf.
    - Continued deprecation of methods called _form by adding a warning
      when you use that name for a CRUD or AutoCRUD form in your bigtop file.
    - Added gen_root keyword for CGI Gantry, HttpdConf Gantry, and
      Conf General backends to take advantage of Gantry's new Init module,
      which keeps track of root paths for us.  Only the app root path is
      needed adding gen_root inserts one with relative path html.
    - SiteLook GantryDefault now has a default gantry_wrapper formed
      from Gantry::Init::base_root . '/sample_wrapper.tt'
    - Fixed bug in mysql and sqlite backends.  They no longer generate
      create sequence statements.
    - Added optional tables to bigtop --new.  If you supply them you get
      a running app immediately after generation (but remember to make
      the database before trying to run it).
    - Silenced warnings from MySQL and SQLite SQL backends when the input
      has sequence blocks, which they ignore.
    - Started using the getpwuid approach of h2xs when no author info is
      available.
    - Base modules now have do_mains showing links to all the pages which
      have page_link_labels.  All controllers generated by bigtop --new
      have those labels, so out of the box apps have good do_mains.
    - Greatly improved defaults in tentmaker, among the changes:
        author is omitted so it can be generated in the manner of h2xs
        SiteLook GantryDefault backend no longer has a gantry_wrapper path
        making a table now automatically makes a corresponding controller
        auto-made controllers have:
            statements: controls_table, rel_location, text_description,
                        page_link_label
            methods: do_main, form
        making a sequence now automatically makes a table and a controller
        auto-made tables have sequence statements
      All this means that by starting tentmaker and creating only a table
      on the app_body tab, you can save and get a running app in 3 steps.
    - Removed Class::DBI specific generated code from Control Gantry backend
      (it was a set of skeletons to use with Gantry::Plugins::CRUD).
      Now you get comments telling you what to do, you do it for your ORM.
    - Added site_links methods to base modules.
    - Corrected TentMaker module to be less unix specific.
    - Dropped blib/lib from use lib statements in app.server.
    - Removed CDBI specific code from crud methods, now you just get comments
      suggesting what you need to do.
    - Added advice message to bigtop when you create a default app.
      It tells you how to start the app.

0.13 Fri Jun  9 08:08:16 CDT 2006
    - Made it possible for compatible backends of the same type to all
      generate.  For instance, this allows you to generate all types of SQL
      schema at once.  Note that most backends still can't work together
      since they want to write the same file (like models and controllers).
    - Converted authors app level keyword to allow name => user@example.com.
    - Since the above change left the app level keyword email unused,
      I changed it to contact_us which now makes a CONTACT US POD section 
      in the base module with whatever you want to appear there.
    - Added docs to Bigtop::Keywords explaining how to add your own keywords.
    - Tried to hide the AST package statements from the PAUSE indexer
      without hiding them during vim folding.
    - Added pair_required to Bigtop::Keywords keys so we can support things
      like Gantry main listing header_options.
    - Added config level model_base_class keyword to each Model backend.
      This allows you to control it once for all tables, but still lets
      individual tables override it with their own table level model_base_class.
    - Corrected the javascript error that was preventing screen updates for
      App Body block deletions.  There is a remaining problem: the visible
      whitespace gap sometimes grows with each deletion (this affects only
      the on screen appearance, so it is completely consmetic).
    - Added POD to generated model modules.  It should be enough to silence
      POD tests.

0.12 Tue May 23 10:58:22 CDT 2006
    - Added create_makefile_pl => 'passthrough', to Build.PL so users relying
      on make (aka CPAN shell users) can install without so much hastle.
    - Corrected images links in the tentmaker tutorial (thanks Krassi).
    - Added support for DBIx::Class.
    - Updated MANIFEST and made it agree with what is checked into svn.

0.11 Wed May 17 12:48:11 CDT 2006
    - Added skips so gantry controller tests won't fail when
      Gantry::Plugins::AutoCRUD is not installed.
    - Added Bigtop::Docs::TentTut a screen shot laden tour of app building
      with tentmaker.
    - Added a backend to make SQL for MySQL.

0.10 Fri May 12 14:50 CDT 2006
    - Added Test::Files to build_requires list.
    - Added a backend to make SQL for SQLite.
    - Added a --help message to bigtop script.

0.09 Wed May 10 10:41:49 CDT 2006
    - Improved Build.PL so it won't try to install tentmaker templates
      without Gantry.

0.08 Wed May 10 07:47:23 CDT 2006
    - Improved the usability of tentmaker (I hope) by putting former tooltips
      into boxes which are always visible and expanding and clarifying the
      text in those tips.
    - Changed the name of the generated default wrapper to genwrapper.tt
      so that users of bigtop never again see the wrapper.tt which ships
      with gantry.
    - Added support for app level literals to tentmaker.

0.07 Fri May  5 15:39:16 CDT 2006
    - Added server_port statement to CGI Gantry backend so you can
      decide on a test server port in advance.
    - Removed two unitialized value warnings from GantryDefault Sitelook
      backend.
    - Factored backend loading out of gen_from_string so other Bigtop::Parser
      routines can share it (think parse_string).
    - Corrected syntax errors in generated CRUD helper methods.
    - Added TentMaker.
    - Implemented deparser (first draft) to support TentMaker.
    - Moved all backends into the Backend namespace.
    - Added documentation methods to all backends, so TentMaker can describe
      what they do for its users.
    - Factored out grammar from Bigtop::Parser and had Parse::RecDescent
      precompile it.  This results in almost a four fold speed savings
      in the test suite.  It should give a similar savings to invocations
      of bigtop and tentmaker.
    - Made generated stand alone server accept its port from the command line.
    - Added blib/lib and lib to the stand alone server's path.
    - Made table_element_blocks and field_statements optional.

0.06 Thu Mar 23 08:26:46 CST 2006
    - Added use_clean_dates to the options generated for crud constructor
      calls when a controller's type is CRUD.
    - Corrected CRUD do_add, do_edit, and do_delete so they call CRUD
      methods through the correct object. 
    - Made CGI backend respect literal PerlTop statement, so you can put
      use libs into the top of the generated CGI script just as you do
      in the top of the <Perl> block of httpd.conf for mod_perl.
    - Added explicit import list option to uses statements in controller
      blocks generated by Gantry Control backend.
    - Improved error messages when block names or keywords in the
      grammar (like literal) are misspelled.
    - Made literal types into bonifide keywords of app_literal and
      controller_literal type, so better error messages result when
      the keywords are misspelled and better docs exist about who
      defined which literal type.
    - Changed set_vars block keyword to config to make it more independent
      of mod_perl.  set_vars is retained as a synoym for legacy bigtop
      files, but is no longer documented for use (expect a mention
      in the Syntax doc, where it is marked deprecated).
    - Added html_form_constraint as a field statement which Control
      backends should use to supply Data::FormValidator constraints.
    - Made the Gantry Control backend respect html_form_constraint.
    - Made vim folding optional in the bigtop.syntax file.  To get it,
          let bigtop_fold=1
      in your .vimrc file.
    - Added skip_config statement to Bigtop::HttpdConf::Gantry backend,
      so you can still get httpd.conf locations, but have your conf
      in some other place (like a Gantry::Conf Config::General flat file).
      If you still need a PerlSetVar like GantryConfInstance, use a
      literal statement.
    - Added Bigtop::Conf::General to write Config::General style conf files.
    - Gantry base modules now have their init commented out if it would
      only defer to Gantry.pm via SUPER.
    - Added with_server statement to Bigtop::CGI::Gantry which makes
      a Gantry::Server based stand alone server for the app.
      Using it saves configuring apache.
    - Added new lines after literals which don't end in whitespace.
    - Added support for Gantry::Conf to the CGI Gantry backend (use
      the instance keyword).

0.05 Wed Feb  1 14:15:33 CST 2006
    - Added support for new Gantry::Utils::Model
    - Removed no_accessor set vars from init methods at the app level.
    - Removed no_accessor set vars from init methods at the controller level.
    - Removed int as a shorthand for int4 in postgres backends.
    - Added model_base_class keyword at the table level and made
      Bigtop::Model::GantryCDBI pay attention to it.
    - Made Bigtop::Model::Gantry pay attention to model_base_class.
    - Corrected models made by Bigtop::Model::Gantry to conform to the
      current (experimental) Gantry::Utils::Model.
    - Fixed CRUD_form method type in Gantry control generation so it
      include the row (fished out of $data)
    - Filled in get_quoted_columns method in B::M::G.
    - Added PerlTop literal block so use libs can appear in <Perl>
      blocks before the first use statement.
    - Fixed B::M::Gantry to use fully qualified foreign table names when
      fetching foreign objects.
    - Made bigtop script delete _Inline (if its in the current directory)
      by default and added a flag (--keep_inline or -k) for keeping it.
    - Greatly expanded the amount of code generated for Gantry::Plugins::CRUD.
      Users get this extra code by setting the controller type with is CRUD.
    - Changed from mixin to inheritence scheme for cdbi models.

0.04 Tue Jan  3 16:04:56 CST 2006
    - Made extra_args behave as Bigtop::Control::Gantry's docs say it should.
    - Cleaned handling and error messages surrounding base_dir and app_dir
      config statements.
    - Documented --create's treatement of base_dir and app_dir.
    - Added -c as an abbreviation for --create.
    - Added not_for keyword for table fields, made the cdbi model pay
      attention to it, so we can have a non-key id fields in the database,
      but leave it out of the model (which would choke on it).
    - Added not_for keyword for tables, made cdbi model pay attention to it,
      so we can support users who like to edit GEN modules.
    - Made postgres SQL backend respect not_for keyword on tables, allowing
      models to be made for tables that will be created with something other
      than the generated schema.sql.
    - Added generation of CRUD_forms for the recently added
      Gantry::Plugins::CRUD.
    - Added --new as an option to bigtop script.  It makes the directory
      structure for a new app from scratch.
    - Made Bigtop::Control::Gantry respect method level no_gen.
    - Added literal statement at app level and made Postgres backend
      honor it.
    - Made Gantry::HttpdConf honor literal statement at app level.
    - Added literal statement at controller level and made Gantry::HttpdConf
      honor it.
    - Renamed app level url to location.
    - Renamed controller level url to rel_location and introduced the new
      controller level location.  The former are relative to the app location
      while the latter are absolute.
    - Added controller level set_vars block.  Made B::HttpdConf::Gantry
      and B::Control::Gantry backends honor it.
    - Added col_labels to Gantry main_listing methods in B::C::Gantry.

0.03 Tue Dec 13 08:59:34 CST 2005
    - Made corrections pointed out by using bigtop to make a second,
      more complex app.
    - Changed the name of the generation script to simply bigtop.
    - Added vim syntax highlighting file to distribution.
    - Made the gantry control generator quieter (it no longer tells
      you about every file it decides not to overwrite).
    - Made the cdbi model generator quieter (it no longer tells
      you about every file it decides not to overwrite).
    - Made it legal to define a controller with an empty block.
    - Discarded GENed controllers that have nothing in them and kept all
      references to them out of the corresponding stub.
    - Added --create flag to bigtop script and now ignore (with a warning)
      base_dir and app_dir in bigtop files when the new flag is not used.

0.02  Fri Oct 28 07:37:37 CDT 2005
    - Made all the corrections pointed out by using bigtop to
      make a production app.
    - Expanded (or wrote) documentation of the modules.

0.01  Thu Sep 15 09:05:07 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AXn WADL
    - manually converted to use Module::Build
