Revision history for Perl extension Bigtop.

0.12 Tue May 23 10:58:22 CDT 2006
    - Added create_makefile_pl => 'passthrough', to Build.PL so users relying
      on make (aka CPAN shell users) can install without so much hastle.
    - Corrected images links in the tentmaker tutorial (thanks Krassi).
    - Added support for DBIx::Class.
    - Updated MANIFEST and made it agree with what is checked into svn.

0.11 Wed May 17 12:48:11 CDT 2006
    - Added skips so gantry controller tests won't fail when
      Gantry::Plugins::AutoCRUD is not installed.
    - Added Bigtop::Docs::TentTut a screen shot laden tour of app building
      with tentmaker.
    - Added a backend to make SQL for MySQL.

0.10 Fri May 12 14:50 CDT 2006
    - Added Test::Files to build_requires list.
    - Added a backend to make SQL for SQLite.
    - Added a --help message to bigtop script.

0.09 Wed May 10 10:41:49 CDT 2006
    - Improved Build.PL so it won't try to install tentmaker templates
      without Gantry.

0.08 Wed May 10 07:47:23 CDT 2006
    - Improved the usability of tentmaker (I hope) by putting former tooltips
      into boxes which are always visible and expanding and clarifying the
      text in those tips.
    - Changed the name of the generated default wrapper to genwrapper.tt
      so that users of bigtop never again see the wrapper.tt which ships
      with gantry.
    - Added support for app level literals to tentmaker.

0.07 Fri May  5 15:39:16 CDT 2006
    - Added server_port statement to CGI Gantry backend so you can
      decide on a test server port in advance.
    - Removed two unitialized value warnings from GantryDefault Sitelook
      backend.
    - Factored backend loading out of gen_from_string so other Bigtop::Parser
      routines can share it (think parse_string).
    - Corrected syntax errors in generated CRUD helper methods.
    - Added TentMaker.
    - Implemented deparser (first draft) to support TentMaker.
    - Moved all backends into the Backend namespace.
    - Added documentation methods to all backends, so TentMaker can describe
      what they do for its users.
    - Factored out grammar from Bigtop::Parser and had Parse::RecDescent
      precompile it.  This results in almost a four fold speed savings
      in the test suite.  It should give a similar savings to invocations
      of bigtop and tentmaker.
    - Made generated stand alone server accept its port from the command line.
    - Added blib/lib and lib to the stand alone server's path.
    - Made table_element_blocks and field_statements optional.

0.06 Thu Mar 23 08:26:46 CST 2006
    - Added use_clean_dates to the options generated for crud constructor
      calls when a controller's type is CRUD.
    - Corrected CRUD do_add, do_edit, and do_delete so they call CRUD
      methods through the correct object. 
    - Made CGI backend respect literal PerlTop statement, so you can put
      use libs into the top of the generated CGI script just as you do
      in the top of the <Perl> block of httpd.conf for mod_perl.
    - Added explicit import list option to uses statements in controller
      blocks generated by Gantry Control backend.
    - Improved error messages when block names or keywords in the
      grammar (like literal) are misspelled.
    - Made literal types into bonifide keywords of app_literal and
      controller_literal type, so better error messages result when
      the keywords are misspelled and better docs exist about who
      defined which literal type.
    - Changed set_vars block keyword to config to make it more independent
      of mod_perl.  set_vars is retained as a synoym for legacy bigtop
      files, but is no longer documented for use (expect a mention
      in the Syntax doc, where it is marked deprecated).
    - Added html_form_constraint as a field statement which Control
      backends should use to supply Data::FormValidator constraints.
    - Made the Gantry Control backend respect html_form_constraint.
    - Made vim folding optional in the bigtop.syntax file.  To get it,
          let bigtop_fold=1
      in your .vimrc file.
    - Added skip_config statement to Bigtop::HttpdConf::Gantry backend,
      so you can still get httpd.conf locations, but have your conf
      in some other place (like a Gantry::Conf Config::General flat file).
      If you still need a PerlSetVar like GantryConfInstance, use a
      literal statement.
    - Added Bigtop::Conf::General to write Config::General style conf files.
    - Gantry base modules now have their init commented out if it would
      only defer to Gantry.pm via SUPER.
    - Added with_server statement to Bigtop::CGI::Gantry which makes
      a Gantry::Server based stand alone server for the app.
      Using it saves configuring apache.
    - Added new lines after literals which don't end in whitespace.
    - Added support for Gantry::Conf to the CGI Gantry backend (use
      the instance keyword).

0.05 Wed Feb  1 14:15:33 CST 2006
    - Added support for new Gantry::Utils::Model
    - Removed no_accessor set vars from init methods at the app level.
    - Removed no_accessor set vars from init methods at the controller level.
    - Removed int as a shorthand for int4 in postgres backends.
    - Added model_base_class keyword at the table level and made
      Bigtop::Model::GantryCDBI pay attention to it.
    - Made Bigtop::Model::Gantry pay attention to model_base_class.
    - Corrected models made by Bigtop::Model::Gantry to conform to the
      current (experimental) Gantry::Utils::Model.
    - Fixed CRUD_form method type in Gantry control generation so it
      include the row (fished out of $data)
    - Filled in get_quoted_columns method in B::M::G.
    - Added PerlTop literal block so use libs can appear in <Perl>
      blocks before the first use statement.
    - Fixed B::M::Gantry to use fully qualified foreign table names when
      fetching foreign objects.
    - Made bigtop script delete _Inline (if its in the current directory)
      by default and added a flag (--keep_inline or -k) for keeping it.
    - Greatly expanded the amount of code generated for Gantry::Plugins::CRUD.
      Users get this extra code by setting the controller type with is CRUD.
    - Changed from mixin to inheritence scheme for cdbi models.

0.04 Tue Jan  3 16:04:56 CST 2006
    - Made extra_args behave as Bigtop::Control::Gantry's docs say it should.
    - Cleaned handling and error messages surrounding base_dir and app_dir
      config statements.
    - Documented --create's treatement of base_dir and app_dir.
    - Added -c as an abbreviation for --create.
    - Added not_for keyword for table fields, made the cdbi model pay
      attention to it, so we can have a non-key id fields in the database,
      but leave it out of the model (which would choke on it).
    - Added not_for keyword for tables, made cdbi model pay attention to it,
      so we can support users who like to edit GEN modules.
    - Made postgres SQL backend respect not_for keyword on tables, allowing
      models to be made for tables that will be created with something other
      than the generated schema.sql.
    - Added generation of CRUD_forms for the recently added
      Gantry::Plugins::CRUD.
    - Added --new as an option to bigtop script.  It makes the directory
      structure for a new app from scratch.
    - Made Bigtop::Control::Gantry respect method level no_gen.
    - Added literal statement at app level and made Postgres backend
      honor it.
    - Made Gantry::HttpdConf honor literal statement at app level.
    - Added literal statement at controller level and made Gantry::HttpdConf
      honor it.
    - Renamed app level url to location.
    - Renamed controller level url to rel_location and introduced the new
      controller level location.  The former are relative to the app location
      while the latter are absolute.
    - Added controller level set_vars block.  Made B::HttpdConf::Gantry
      and B::Control::Gantry backends honor it.
    - Added col_labels to Gantry main_listing methods in B::C::Gantry.

0.03 Tue Dec 13 08:59:34 CST 2005
    - Made corrections pointed out by using bigtop to make a second,
      more complex app.
    - Changed the name of the generation script to simply bigtop.
    - Added vim syntax highlighting file to distribution.
    - Made the gantry control generator quieter (it no longer tells
      you about every file it decides not to overwrite).
    - Made the cdbi model generator quieter (it no longer tells
      you about every file it decides not to overwrite).
    - Made it legal to define a controller with an empty block.
    - Discarded GENed controllers that have nothing in them and kept all
      references to them out of the corresponding stub.
    - Added --create flag to bigtop script and now ignore (with a warning)
      base_dir and app_dir in bigtop files when the new flag is not used.

0.02  Fri Oct 28 07:37:37 CDT 2005
    - Made all the corrections pointed out by using bigtop to
      make a production app.
    - Expanded (or wrote) documentation of the modules.
