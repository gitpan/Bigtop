=head1 USE

All field keywords beginning with C<html_form_> are passed directly
into the form hash.  Thus, they are really defined in form.tt which
ships with Gantry.

C<html_form_display_size> specifies the size attribute of a text input
element on the HTML form.  This would be called C<html_form_size>,
except that TT has a pseudo-function by that name.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the newly created Kids directory and look in the form method
in lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm.
