=head1 USE

All field keywords beginning with C<html_form_> are passed directly
into the form hash.  Thus, they are really defined in form.tt which
ships with Gantry.

Use C<html_form_raw_html> if you need to put HTML directly into the
entry form's table.  Your html will be immediately before the <tr>
for the current field.  For it to appear in the table, you need to
wrap it in a <tr>.  Clever tricks are possible.  Remember to quote carefully.
Some experimentation might be required.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the newly created Kids directory and look in the form method
in lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm, but run app.server and point your browser to
http://localhost:8080/child/add to see the result.
