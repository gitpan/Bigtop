=head1 USE

Fields are usually presented to users in main listing tables and on add/edit
forms, or used for various control structures in each controller.  The
C<pseudo_value> statement provides a way to use 'pseudo' columns for these
various purposes.  The definition of a pseudo column is a complex query/field
that is not actually part of the table itself, but has been given an alias so
that it can be treated as if it were.
