=head1 USE

All field keywords beginning with C<html_form_> are passed directly
into the form hash.  Thus, they are really defined in form.tt which
ships with Gantry.

C<html_form_class> specifies the CSS class of the input element.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the newly created Kids directory and look in the form method
in lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm.
