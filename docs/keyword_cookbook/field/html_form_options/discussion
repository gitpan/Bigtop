=head1 USE

All field keywords beginning with C<html_form_> are passed directly
into the form hash.  Thus, they are really defined in form.tt which
ships with Gantry.

Use C<html_form_options> to specify the choices for fields of
html_form_type C<select>.  The options are a comma separated list
of pair.  The first member of the pair is the label the user will see,
the second is the value that will be in the params hash.  With AutoCRUD,
the value goes directly into the database.

If you use DBIx::Class, your model will have a method whose name starts
the same as the field, but ends with _display.  Call this method with
the value from the table row; it will return the label ready for display
back to the user.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the newly created Kids directory and look in the form method
in lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm to see the options being passed to the template;
and in lib/Kids/Model/GEN/child.pm for the C<gender_display> method.
