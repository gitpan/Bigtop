=head1 USE

All field keywords beginning with C<html_form_> are passed directly
into the form hash.  Thus, they are really defined in form.tt which
ships with Gantry.

C<html_form_foreign> applies only when the field's html_form_type is display.
It indicates that this field is a foreign key and C<foreign_display>
should be used to get a human readable value to display instead of
showing the rather meaningless foreign row id.

Note that this keyword is usually used when two different versions of
a form are presented depending on the context.  The base form uses
C<html_form_type> select and C<html_form_foreign> is ignored.  Later,
another form is displayed (to a less priviledged user) which uses
C<html_form_type> display.  The form type is usually switched with
the C<Gantry::Utils::FormMunger>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the newly created Kids directory and look in the form method
in lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm.  Note the use of data statements to populate
the table.  See the pod for C<Gantry::Utils::FormMunger> for a more
natural approach.
