=head1 USE

All field keywords beginning with C<html_form_> are passed directly
into the form hash.  Thus, they are really defined in form.tt which
ships with Gantry.

C<html_form_type> specifies the input element type of the field.
You need a type if the field will appear on any form, but not if it won't.
The form.tt template understands these types:

    text
    textarea
    select
    display

Some of the commands apply to specific types:

text: html_form_display_size

textarea: html_form_rows and html_form_cols

select: html_form_options (required unless the field is a foreign key)

display: html_form_foreign

See those related statements for type examples.

NOTE: that the html_form_type is not related to the SQL type, which
is controlled by the C<is> keyword.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the newly created Kids directory and look in the form method
in lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm.
