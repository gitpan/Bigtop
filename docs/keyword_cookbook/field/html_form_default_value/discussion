=head1 USE

All field keywords beginning with C<html_form_> are passed directly
into the form hash.  Thus, they are really defined in form.tt which
ships with Gantry.

C<html_form_default_value> specifies a fall back value to use when no
other default can be found.  Note that this affects HTML only and has nothing
to do with SQL.  For SQL defaults, you need to do something in the C<is>
statement or a literal SQL statement.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the newly created Kids directory and look in the form method in
lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm.
