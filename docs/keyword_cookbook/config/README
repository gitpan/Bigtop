This directory explains the statements you can put in the Bigtop
config section:

    config {
        # this directory's statements here
    }
    app Name {
    }

If you are trying to figure out config blocks that go inside the
app block look in docs/keyword_cookbook/app_config.  But note
that app config blocks don't have specific statements, so the
docs there are set up differently (as a single file).
