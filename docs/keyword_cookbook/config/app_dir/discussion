=head1 USE

The C<app_dir> statement is deprecated.  As far as I can tell no one
is using it.

If you do use it, it will only affect initial generation with -c.
Then it specifies the name of the build directory.  Normally the
name of the build directory is taken from the app name as h2xs does it.

Note that only a single path element is allowed.  You cannot specify
depth as in 'under/here'.  For that you need the equally deprecated
C<base_dir>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Note that the build directory is called C<useless_dir> instead of C<Kids>.
