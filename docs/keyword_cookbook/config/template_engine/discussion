=head1 USE

The bigtop config block keyword C<template_engine> specifies the template
engine for your app.  Gantry only supports C<TT> (Template Toolkit) or
C<Default> (no templating).  Template plugins for Gantry only require
you to write four methods, so it wouldn't be hard to add more.  When you
do, bigtop will support them immediately.  Add them to C<Bigtop::Keywords>
and tentmaker will support them as well.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<TT> in these files:

      docs/httpd.conf 6
      lib/GENKids.pm 8
      t/10_run.t
