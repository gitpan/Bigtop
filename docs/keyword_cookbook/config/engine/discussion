=head1 USE

The bigtop config block keyword C<engine> specifies the Gantry engine
which will serve the app.  But, note that stand alone server scripts
and CGI scripts ignore the value of this statement, since they must
use CGI.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<MP20> in docs/httpd.conf.
