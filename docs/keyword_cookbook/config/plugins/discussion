=head1 USE

Put a C<plugins> keyword in your Bigtop config section to insert one or
more plugins into the base controller.  If you use a controller level
plugins keyword, the top level plugins will be repeated in the that
controller so the plugin can re-register itself in that controller's
namespace.

Note that multiple plugins are allowed, space separate them and remember
to wrap them in backticks.

when you use C<plugins>, you get a -PluginNamespace in you base module
use statement.  Plugins register themselves against that namespace
so multiple apps in the same Apache instance don't have to share
plugins.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<PluginA> in:

    app.cgi
    app.server
    docs/httpd.conf
    t/10_run.t
