This directory explains how app level config blocks work.  They go here:
config {
    # not here, this is for Bigtop and its backends
}
app Name {
    config {
        # here we define the conf for your running application
    }
    config dev {
        # here we override conf with special dev replacements
    }
}

If you need to know about the bigtop config section see
keyword_cookbook/config.  Also note that any backend from the
Bigtop::Backends:: namespace can have a block in that config.
Look in each backend (or click on the backends tab in tentmaker)
for what can go in those blocks.

This directory is set up differently from the others, since there
are no specific keywords in config blocks.  Thus, there are no subdirectories.
There is only one discussion and one example.bigtop.  Both are in this
directory.
