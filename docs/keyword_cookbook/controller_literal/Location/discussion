=head1 USE

C<Location> literals dump output into the Apache Location directive
for the controller if you are using the HttpdConf Gantry backend.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<valid-user> in docs/httpd.conf.

See how the example so cleverly controls indentation so readers never
have to know the output was generated?
