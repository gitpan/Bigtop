=head1 USE

C<GantryLocation> literals dump output into a GantryLocation block
in generated Config::General files if you use the Conf Gantry or
Conf General backends.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<rides_short_bus> in docs/Kids.gantry.conf.

See how the example so cleverly controls indentation so readers never
have to know the output was generated?
