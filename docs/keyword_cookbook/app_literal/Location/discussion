=head1 USE

C<Location> literals dump output into the app's root location in
C<docs/httpd.conf> files, which are used for mod_perl deployment.
There is an analogous literal at the controller level.

While you can put anything in a Location literal, PerlSetVars are
best handled in other ways*.  This literal is really for things like

    require valid-user

*Either allow the HttpdConf Gantry backend to create PerlSetVars based on
config block parameter/value pairs, or (better) use Gantry::Conf.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<require valid-user> in docs/httpd.conf.  Also note the use
of the PerlTop literal to add a use statement for C<Your::Authen::Handler>
to the Perl block.

See how the example so cleverly controls indentation so readers never
have to know the output was generated?
