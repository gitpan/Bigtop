=head1 USE

C<HttpdConf> literals dump output into C<docs/httpd.conf> files, which
are used for mod_perl deployment.  Their output is intermixed with the
location directives made for eacy controller in their order of
appearance in the bigtop file.  This is useful if you need Apache
configuration Bigtop does not understand.

If all you want to do is insert PerlSetVars, use app level config
block statements.  But, consider using Gantry::Conf which and decouples
you from Apache.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

then look for the C<LocationMatch> directive in C<docs/httpd.conf>.  Notice
that it falls between the base controller and the C<child> controller,
in just the order the blocks appear in the bigtop file.  Also notice the
way the whitespace is managed.  One new line is added to the end of the
literal text, because it does not have trailing whitespace.
