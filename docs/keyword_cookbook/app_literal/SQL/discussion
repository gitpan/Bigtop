=head1 USE

C<SQL> literals dump output into all generated C<schema.yourdbhere> files.
Their output is intermixed with tables and join_tables in the order of
appearance in the bigtop file.  This is useful if you need SQL Bigtop
does not understand.  But, it will break database independence, if not
all dataabases understand the SQL you include.

If all you want to do is insert fixed or test data, use table level C<data>
statements.  They save typing and editable with tentmaker.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

then look for the literal SQL in C<docs/schema.sqlite>.  If you use
other SQL backends, they will receive the same literal text at the same
point.
