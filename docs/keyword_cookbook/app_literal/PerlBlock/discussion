=head1 USE

C<PerlBlock> literals dump output into the Perl block in
C<docs/httpd.conf> files, which are used for mod_perl deployment.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<Exotic::Module> in docs/httpd.conf.

See how the example so cleverly controls indentation so readers never
have to know the output was generated?
