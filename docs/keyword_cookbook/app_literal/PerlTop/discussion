=head1 USE

C<PerlTop> literals dump output to multiple files.  For C<docs/httpd.conf>
files, used for mod_perl deployment, its output goes at the top of the Perl
block -- before any other statements, except the shebang.

For CGI scripts and stand alone servers, the output goes directly after
the use strict at the top of the scripts.

This literal is particularly useful for specifying alternate lib paths
as shown in the example.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<exotic>:

    app.cgi
    app.server
    docs/httpd.conf

Notice that clever indentation is more useful for httpd.conf than for
scripts.
