=head1 USE

If your generated controller module needs to load a module, include a
C<gen_uses> statement in your controller's block.

C<gen_uses> takes a comma separated list of modules to use.  If you want
to control their import lists, use pairs.  For example, this will use
the modules with default importing:

    gen_uses Your::Module, Some::Other::Module;

Add pairs to get the imports of your dreams:

    gen_uses Your::Module => `qw( :everything :and then some )`;

Note that the value will be used literally to produce this:

    use Your::Module qw( :everything :and then some );

So, qw is a good choice (as it usually is).

See also C<stub_uses>, C<uses>, and C<plugins>.  The later is likely
the only good choice, if the module you want to use is a Gantry plugin.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<Exotic> in C<lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm>.  Notice how C<Your::Module>
lists imports explicitly.  If you don't provide a list, all of the C<@EXPORT>
items will be explicitly listed.
