=head1 USE

If your controller needs to use a Gantry plugin, add a C<plugins> statement.
But, note that there is also a plugins statement in the Bigtop config
section.  Use the one there to add default plugins for all controllers in the
application.  Use the controller level version to affect only one
controller.

Note that if you have a global C<plugins> statement in the bigtop config
block, using a controller level C<plugins> statement replaces the
plugin list for the controller, so repeat any globals you still need.

All plugins must live in the C<Gantry::Plugins::> namespace, use only the
remainder of the module's package name in the C<plugins> statement.
For example, to use the AuthCookie plugin, say:

    plugins AuthCookie;

The Control Gantry backend will prepend the Gantry plugin namespace.

C<plugins> statements only affect GEN modules, not stubs.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<AuthCookie> in C<lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm>.  Also notice
the PluginNamespace and the namespace method.
