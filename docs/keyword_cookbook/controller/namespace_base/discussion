=head1 USE

Bigtop and Gantry provide limited support for rpc style SOAP.

There is a small but complete working RPC style SOAP example in the
RPCSoap subdirectory of the keyword_cookbook directory.  See the
README in that directory for how to run the working example.

The C<namespace_base> is used by Gantry in WSDL generation.  In
particular, it is everything after http: or https: in the prefix
for all sorts of names.  See wsdl.tt in Gantry's root directory
for which names it affects.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the new Kids directory and look in lib/Kids/GEN/Soap.pm for
'soapstuff'.

NOTE: the example in this directory lacks the code needed to make a
SOAP server respond to requests.  For that see the RPCSoap subdirectory
of the keyword_cookbook directory.
