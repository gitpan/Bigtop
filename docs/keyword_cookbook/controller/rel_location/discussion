=head1 USE

Every controller needs to have either a C<location> or a C<rel_location>
(except the base controller see below) to control its URL.

The C<rel_location> specifies a URL which is relative to the base controller's
URL.  This specifically means that the base controller cannot have
a C<rel_location>.

What if you need a module that will not be mounted on a URL?  Then,
in my terminology, that module is not a controller.  You are welcome
to have such modules in your application, just don't tell Bigtop about
them.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and start app.server.  Look for C<rascals>
in the list of URL choices.
