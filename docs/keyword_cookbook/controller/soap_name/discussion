=head1 USE

Bigtop and Gantry provide limited support for rpc style SOAP.

There is a small but complete working RPC style SOAP example in the
RPCSoap subdirectory of the keyword_cookbook directory.  It was originally
built with the example.bigtop in this directory, but has had code added
to make the service work.  See the README in that directory for how to
run the working example.

The C<soap_name> keyword controls the base of all WSDL names when ask Gantry
to generate WSDL files for you.  While largely intended as documentation,
that name may matter to your clients and should include something specific
to your application.

Examples of names that will begin with the C<soap_name>:

    wsdl:definitions name attribute
    portType name attribute
    binding name attributes
    etc.

See wsdl.tt in Gantry's root directory for all the details.

Specify domain information with the C<namespace_base> controller keyword.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the new Kids directory and look in lib/Kids/GEN/Soap.pm for
'KidSOAPName'.

NOTE: the example built in this way will not work properly, since bigtop
makes a stub of the service, leaving you to fill in code.  See the RPCSoap
subdirectory of the keyword_cookbook directory for a working example.
