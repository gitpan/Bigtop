=head1 USE

The C<autocrud_helper> keyword is not very useful.  If your controller uses
DBIx::Class and C<Gantry::Plugins::AutoCRUD>, use this to override the
default AutoCRUD helper with one you write yourself.  The default
helper is C<Gantry::Plugins::AutoCRUDHelper::DBIxClass> and your helper
must provide the same API.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<NonStandard> in lib/Kids/Child.pm.
Note that you must write and install C<ORM::NonStandard>.
