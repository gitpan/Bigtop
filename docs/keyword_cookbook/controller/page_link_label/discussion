=head1 USE

The C<page_link_label> places the page's URL into the navigation links.
If you don't include a C<page_link_label>, the page will not be reachable
from default naviagation links.  You'll need some other way for users
to get to it.

=head1 THE EXAMPLE

When you try to build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

change to the Kids directory and start app.server (note that you might
need to build the sqlite database first).  Hit the base url:

    http://localhost:8080/

And notice the Child link there.  If you click on that link, it will
take you to the Child controller's page.  There you should see the
dev navigation pull down menu, which will also include Child.
