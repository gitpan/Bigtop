=head1 USE

Every controller needs to have either a C<location> or a C<rel_location>
(except the base controller see below) to control its URL.

The C<location> specifies a URL which is relative to the server's
document root.  This specifically means that the base controller's
location is not considered (for that use C<rel_location> instead).

What if you need a module that will not be mounted on a URL?  Then,
in my terminology, that module is not a controller.  You are welcome
to have such modules in your application, just don't tell Bigtop about
them.

=head2 Base Controllers

The C<location> statement behaves slightly differently for the base
controller.  If used in a base controller, C<location> specifies the
absolute URL path from the server's document root, just as for regular
controllers.  But, this location becomes the anchoring location to
which all C<rel_locations> are relative.

Note that you could also use the deprecated app level C<location> statement
for this purpose.  Don't use both, the effect is not dependable.  This
statement is prefered.

Also note that the stand alone server probably won't play well with
a non-default base location.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

change to the Kids directory, start app.server, and look for C<rascals>
in the available URLs list.
