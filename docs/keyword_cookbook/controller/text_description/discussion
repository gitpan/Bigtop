=head1 USE

The C<text_description> is used by CRUD schemes in various places, notably
to fill in the blank in 'Delete ____?'

At present the description is put into the C<text_description> method
which is generated in the stub.  In particular, this means that changing
the description in the bigtop file has no affect once the controller is
generated.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<wild child> C<lib/Kids/Child.pm>.
