=head1 USE

One of the most commonly used controller keywords, C<controls_table>
must be the name of a C<table> block in the same bigtop file.  This adds
a use statement for the table's model and provides the link between
controller methods and the underlying table.  This affects things like
column labels on main listings, HTML form input element labels, etc.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look in C<lib/Kids/Child.pm> to see

    use Kids::Model::child qw(
        $CHILD
    );

    #...
    sub get_model_name {
        return $CHILD;
    }

The model use statement is repeated in C<lib/Kids/GEN/Child.pm> from
which C<Kids::Child> inherits.  To see side affects of C<controls_table>,
look in the generated C<do_main>:

    my $retval = {
        headings       => [
            'Name',
            'Birth Day',
        ],
    };

The C<Name> and C<Birth Day> labels were taken from the C<label> statements of
fields blocks in the C<child>table, because they were listed in the C<cols>
statement.

Other similar magic happens because of C<controls_table>.
