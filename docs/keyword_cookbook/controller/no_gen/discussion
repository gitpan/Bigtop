=head1 USE

The C<no_gen> keyword at the controller level turns off all generation
of the controller and its methods.  Use this when you've been very
naughty and modified the GEN module to avoid having Bigtop overwrite
your changes, or when you are overwhelmed with paranoia.

Note that the value of this statement must be true.  I usually use
1 as the value.

=head1 THE EXAMPLE

When you try to build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

bigtop will create everything as normal except make the stub/GEN
pair for the Child controller.
