=head1 USE

If your stub needs to load a module, include a C<stub_uses> statement in
your controller's block.  But, note that this won't have any effect if
the controller has already been created.  Bigtop never modifies an
existing controller stub.

C<stub_uses> takes a comma separated list of modules to use.  If you want
to control their import lists, use pairs.  For example, this will use
the modules with default importing:

    stub_uses Your::Module, Some::Other::Module;

Add pairs to get the imports of your dreams:

    stub_uses Your::Module => `qw( :everything :and then some )`;

Note that the value will be used literally to produce this:

    use Your::Module qw( :everything :and then some );

So, qw is a good choice (as it usually is).

See also C<gen_uses> and C<uses> for other ways to use modules.

The C<plugins> keyword is the way to load Gantry plugin modules from
the C<Gantry::Plugins::> namespace.

Note that nothing is every added to a stub once it is made, so C<stub_uses>
statements added after stub generation are ignored by bigtop, but they
could still serve as documentation.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Build the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Look for C<Exotic> in C<lib/Kids/Child.pm>.  Notice how C<Your::Module>
lists imports explicitly.  If you don't provide a list, all of the
C<@EXPORT> items will be explicitly listed.
