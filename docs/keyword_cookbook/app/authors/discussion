=head1 USE

The C<authors> keyword controls what names appear in the AUTHOR POD sections
at the bottom of Perl modules.  You can specify multiple authors by
separating them with commas.  For each author, you may include an
optional email address by using a pair instead of a single name:

    authors `Phil Crow` => `crow.phil@gmail.com`, `Someone Else`;

No email address will be shown unless you use a pair for the author.

If you omit this keyword, you get the same default you would get from h2xs.
That is, you get the name from the gcos field in /etc/passwd, or its moral
equivalent for your system and a manufactured email address which is rarely
correct.

If you omit the copyright_holder keyword, the first person listed in authors
will be the default copyright_holder.

If you use kick start syntax like this:

    bigtop -n AppName 'tbl1(col1,col2)->tbl2(cola)'

no authors statement will be included, unless you have a file called
C<.bigtopdef> in your home directory.  If you have that file, it must be
a valid bigtop file in it, which may include an authors statement.

=head1 THE EXAMPLE

In the example, the above author statement is used.  When you build
the example with:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for Phil Crow in these files:

 README
 docs/kids.bigtop
 lib/GENKids.pm
 lib/Kids.pm
 lib/Kids/Child.pm
 lib/Kids/GENModel.pm
 lib/Kids/Model.pm

'Someone Else' appears in all of those except README, where Phil is listed
solely because he is the default copyright holder.
