=head1 USE

The C<license_text> keyword allows you to specify the copyright
license for your project.  If you omit the keyword, you get the
standard Perl 5.8.6 license text (which h2xs produced for that version
of Perl).

As with many other app statements, you probably want to have a C<.bigtopdef>
file in your home directory to specify them.  C<.bigtopdef> is used by
both tentmaker and bigtop when they are invoked with the -n flag.  If
you have a C<.bigtopdef>, it may contain anything, so long as it is a
valid bigtop file.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<Reserved> in these files:

    README
    docs/example.bigtop
    lib/GENKids.pm
    lib/Kids.pm
    lib/Kids/Child.pm
    lib/Kids/GENModel.pm
    lib/Kids/Model.pm
