=head1 USE

The C<uses> keyword is deprecated.  It was used to specify the modules
to use in the base module of the application.  You should put a C<uses>
statement in the base_controller block to achieve this behavior.

Better yet, you should really use C<gen_uses> and C<stub_uses> so the
modules are used only where they are needed.

This statement puts listed modules into both the stub and the gen module,
but always remember that the stub is only built once and is never regenerated.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<Scalar> in these files:

    docs/example.bigtop 15
    lib/GENKids.pm 15
    lib/Kids.pm

Notice that this form of uses does not allow you to control imports
from the used modules.  The other forms do, which is all the more
reason to choose them.

For a better approach, build:

    bigtop -c example.better.bigtop all

(Note that you will need to delete or rename the Kids directory.  Otherwise,
bigtop will fail while complaining loudly that the build directory already
exists.)

Again, look for C<Scalar> in the same files.  It shows how to specify
import lists.

Finally, for the best approach build:

    bigtop -c example.best.bigtop all

Look for C<Scalar> in C<lib/Kids.pm> and for C<Some> in C<lib/GENKids.pm>.
