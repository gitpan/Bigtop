=head1 USE

The C<location> keyword is deprecated.  It was used to specify the base
location for the application.  You should put a C<location> statement
in the base_controller block to achieve this behavior.

Note that if you use a C<location>, you probably need an C<app_rootp>
config parameter in the app level C<config> block.  But, don't expect
to use either of those with a stand alone server.  It doesn't play
well with non-default paths.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<example> in these files:

  docs/kids.bigtop
  lib/GENKids.pm
  lib/Kids.pm
  lib/Kids/Child.pm

Notice that this affects the CGI script, the stand alone server, and
the httpd.conf.  The stand alone server probably won't work correctly
with a non-default location (even if you put the location statement
in the base_controller block).
