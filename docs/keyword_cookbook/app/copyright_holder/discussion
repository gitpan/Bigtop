=head1 USE

Use the C<copyright_holder> keyword to control the copyright attribution
in generated files.  To control the copyright license test, use
C<license_text>.

By default the first author listed in the C<authors> statement is
the copyright holder.  If no authors statement is used, the default
copyright holder is the current logged in user, whose copyright attribution
will come from the gcos field of /etc/passwd or its moral equivalent.

To specify the copyright holder, use this statement.  Remember to use
backticks to quote the copyright holder's name if it wouldn't work as
a Perl identifer.

Note that you probably want to have a C<.bigtopdef> file in your home
directory with a C<copyright_holder> statement if you use bigtop -n to
build your new applications.  If you have that file, it must be a
valid bigtop file, and it will be the default for bigtop and tentmaker
when they are invoked with the -n flag.
