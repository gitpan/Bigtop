=head1 USE

The C<email> keyword is deprecated.  It was used to specify emails
for C<authors> before that statement started taking pairs.

It now works like C<contact_us>, but if you use both C<email>
and C<contact_us>, C<email will be ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLE

To see an example, build:

    bigtop -c example.bigtop all

Change to the Kids directory and look for C<example> in these files:

  docs/kids.bigtop
  lib/GENKids.pm
  lib/Kids.pm
  lib/Kids/Child.pm
