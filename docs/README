This directory is back.  While most of the docs have moved to the
Bigtop::Docs:: namespace, there are still things here.

1. The keyword_cookbook subdirectory contains at least one example of
how to use every keyword that Bigtop understands.  Running tentmaker
or looking in Bigtop::Docs::FullKeywords lists each keyword with discussion,
the keyword_cookbook has more discussion and examples.

The keyword_cookbook entries are divided by the type of the keyword.
That type governs where the keyword appears in the bigtop file.  These
are the types:

    config              - top level conig block
    app                 - app level
    app_literal         - app level literal types
    controller          - controller level
    controller_literal  - controller level literal types
    field               - field level
    join_table          - join table level
    method              - method level
    table               - table level

Each type has a directory.  Each keyword is a subdirectory of the
type directory.  In each keyword subdirectory, there are (at least) two files
(or there will be some day): discussion and example.bigtop.  The discussion
has two POD sections.  The C<USE> section explains how, when, and where to
use the keyword.  The C<EXAMPLE> section explains how to build the example
and where to look for the results of the keyword in the resulting genreated
code.

The keyword being highlighted always appears at least once in example.bigtop.
The important occurances (the ones mentioned in the discussion file)
are preceded by comments.  No other comments are used.  So, you can
either search for the keyword, or for lines which begin with a # sign.
