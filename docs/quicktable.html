        <h1>Bigtop Quick Reference</h1>
<p>
This page is meant to show what's possible with the Bigtop web app
description language.  It's main feature is a <a href='#quickreftab'>table</a>
summarizing the syntax of the Bigtop language.
</p>
<p>
Each Bigtop file has the following basic structure:
<pre>
    config {
    }
    app App::Name {
    }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Inside those blocks you can have simple statements and other blocks.
Simple statements are a keyword followed by a number, a valid Perl identifier,
or a backquoted string and terminated with a semi-colon.  Sometimes the
values can also be lists of single values separated by commas.  In rarer
cases, the values can themselves be key/value pairs.  As in Perl, the keys
and values are separated with the fat comma =&gt;.  See below for details.
</p>
<h2>The Key Strangeness</h2>
<p>
One syntax feature that strikes people funny is that Bigtop uses backquotes
around strings.  The reason is simple.  Bigtop never shells out,
but it often needs to store Perl's favorite quotes in strings.  Using
backquotes makes it easy to embed either single or double quotes in
its strings.
</p>
<h2>A Bigger Example</h2>
<p>
Before going into the <a href='#quickreftab'>table of descriptions</a>, it
might help to see a bigger example:
<pre>
config {
    engine          MP13;
    template_engine TT;
    Init            Std      { no_gen 1; }
    SQL             Postgres {}
}
app Simple::Sample {
    authors               `Phil Crow`;
    set_vars              { dbconn `dbi:Pg:dbname=simple` =&gt; no_accessor; }
    sequence contacts_seq {}
    table contacts        {
        sequence contacts_seq;
        field id   { is int4, primary_key, assign_by_sequence; }
        field name {
            is              varchar;
            label          `Contact Person`;
            html_form_type text;
        }
    }
    controller Names {
        controls_table   names;
        uses             Gantry::Plugins::AutoCRUD;
        text_description `contact name`;
        method do_main is main_listing {
            title           `Contact Names`;
            cols            name;
            header_options  Add;
            row_options     Edit, Delete;
        }
        method _form is AutoCRUD_form {
            fields          name;
            extra_keys
               legend     =&gt; `$self-&gt;>path_info =~ /edit/i ? 'Edit' : 'Add'`;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<a name='quickreftab' />
<h2>The Quick Reference Table</h2>
<p>
The following table tries to cover all the statements and blocks available,
but keep in mind that backends can add simple statements of their own.
So, the table may be incomplete.

            LEGAL BLOCKS
        </td>
        <td>
            In the config section, blocks represent backend generators.
            Each generator has a type and a name.  These translate directly
            to the name of the module which will do the generating.  So,
           <pre> SQL Postgres {}</pre>
            means use Bigtop::SQL::Postgres.  Further,
            it means that the user of bigtop at the command line can request
            generation of postgres SQL by saying
            <pre>bigtop app.bigtop SQL</pre>
            Finally, if the user of bigtop at the command line types:
            <pre>bigtop app.bigtop all</pre>
            each generator will be called on to make its files in
            the order it is listed in the config section.
            <br/>
            All blocks accept no_gen.  Use this statement when you no longer
            want the generator to do anything.  But, don't omit the generator
            entirely.  That will likely cause parse errors, since it won't be
            able to register it's keywords.
            <br/>
            Most blocks accept template.  Use this statement to specify
            an alternate template for the backend.  It will be used instead
            of the Inline::TT template hard coded in the backend.
            Templates define a set of BLOCKS.
            To see what blocks you must define and what parameters they
            have to work with, examine the templates hard coded in the
            backend(s) of interest to you.  Example:
            <br/>
            SQL Postgres { template `my_postgres.tt`; }
