Bigtop version 0.15
===========================

Bigtop is a central place to collect everything that has anything to
do with your database driven web application.  I call it a Web Application
Data Language.

By specifying a Bigtop file and running bigtop on it, you can generate
a working web application.  As things change (like the data model), you
can rerun bigtop to update the generated parts of the application without
fear of loosing the parts you wrote by hand.

See Bigtop::Docs::Tutorial for details.
