Change to the app_dir.

Create the databse (createdb for postgres).
Build the database structure (psql dbname -U username < docs/schema.sql).

Put in require valid-user (if you need it) in docs/httpd.conf.

Start or Restart the web server.

Edit the README.
Update the docs.

Mention these things during tutorial:

Extra args to controller methods must be simple scalars and should not
have the $ sigil.

The order of things is usually not that important, but things are built in
the order listed.  This means Init needs to be first (it builds the dirs).
It also means that sequence blocks must come before tables that use the
sequences they define.  But it doesn't matter whether controllers are listed
before or after the tables.  The controller order itself governs their
appearance order in httpd.conf (so sub controllers must come after
their parents) and in the links in the menu.

select for refers to fields has - Select - at the top, then all
the fields in string sort order by foreign_display columns.

select for non refers to fields has exactly what you put, the first
item is the default.

html_form_optional means the user does not have to enter it on the form.

non_essential means that CDBI will not fetch it by default.

explain how dates work with the plugin.

Note that row_option Delete is not always a wise one to give.
