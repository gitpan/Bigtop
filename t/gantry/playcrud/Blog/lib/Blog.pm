=head1 NAME

Blog - the base module of this web app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This package is meant to be used in a stand alone server/CGI script or the
Perl block of an httpd.conf file.

Stand Alone Server or CGI script:

    use Blog;

    my $cgi = Gantry::Engine::CGI->new( {
        config => {
            #...
        },
        locations => {
            '/' => 'Blog',
            #...
        },
    } );

httpd.conf:

    <Perl>
        # ...
        use Blog;
    </Perl>

If all went well, one of these was correctly written during app generation.
