Bigtop::Docs::QuickStart - The fastest ways to Gantry apps with Bigtop

=head1 From the Command Line Alone

Suppose you want to keep track of your relatives phone numbers and
their children's birthdays.  After installing sqlite, Gantry, and Bigtop,
type:

    bigtop -n Phone 'family(name,phone,+email)<-child(name,birth_day:date)'
    cd Phone
    ./app.server

There are two tables here.  family has name, phone and optional email columns.
child has name and birth_day which is a date.

If you don't have sqlite, you'll need to build your database.  If your
database engine of choice is postgres or mysql, you can follow these
instructions...

=head2 postgres

    cd Phone
    createdb app.db -U some_power_user
    psql app.db -U regular_user < docs/schema.postgres
    ./app.server -d Pg -u regular_user -p password

=head2 mysql

    cd Phone
    msyqladmin create app.db -u root -p
    mysql -u regular_user -p app.db < docs/schema.mysql
    ./app.server -d mysql -u regular_user -p password

In all cases, once you start C<app.server>, it will print URLs where you
may point your browser to start using the app.

=head1 From a Postgres Database

If you already have a postgres 8 database called yourdb, and would like a
CRUD app for it:

    bigtop -n YourApp -s Pg8Live 'dbi:Pg:dbname=yourdb' user pass
    cd YourApp
    ./app.server -d Pg -n yourdb -u user -p pass
